# embedded-C-with-PIC

## Introduction
Hi! This repository contains a variety of **hardware interface codes for the PIC16F877A microcontroller**. All code is written in embedded C and does not rely on any external librariesâ€”everything is **implemented from scratch**.
Development is done using **[MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide)** for code writing and compilation, and **[SimulIDE]()** for functional simulation and hardware verification.
Both **tools are free, open source**, and easy to use on most platforms.
